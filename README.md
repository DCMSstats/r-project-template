# R Project Template using RStudio

This is a template to begin analysis projects in R Studio.

## Prerequisites

To use this template, you must have the following installed locally:

- Git
- R
- RStudio

You will have an even better experience using this template if you also
install standard system packages for working with R to do analysis:

- devtools
- fs
- config

## Installation

To use this template, click the green **Use this template** button or you can [click
here](https://github.com/aridyckovsky/r-project-template/generate) to generate
your project. It will ask you to name the repository and add a description (optional).

Once the repository is generated, you will be redirected to your new repository.

## Usage

With your new repository, it's time to start using it. Click the green **Code** button
and copy the HTTPS-based URL (just click the clipboard icon!). Then, in your terminal,
run the command

```
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

making sure that you change `username` for your GitHub username
and `repository` for the name of your new repository.
